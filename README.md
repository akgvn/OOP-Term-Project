# OOPTP

An Asteroids-like game project using rlutil for _CENG241: Object Oriented Programming_ course.

## TODO at some point

* Fix the score mechanism. Every time an enemy or a bullet is destroyed, score is incremented. Even if the object is not destroyed by a projectile that the player shot.

* Looks like there are some graphical problems on Solus. Investigate.
